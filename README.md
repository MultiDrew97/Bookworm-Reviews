# Bookworm Reviews
A website project that will host a personal blog and allow users to request books to be reviewed and potentially allow users to be notified when a new review is posted. Also, potentially allow comments (might be too ambitious to start with) so that other users can also share their opinions about the book or the review itself.

# Target Users
The target audiance for this website is anyone looking for a fresh take on reviews of a story/book. Allowing them to see the points of someone else that they might not have heard of before, but are looking for something like that. Someone's points that they might not have even thought about.

# Technologies
The technologies planned for this project is using the MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js). I'll be using the MongoDB to store the blog post information as well as potentially storing contact information for users, in case the notification idea takes off. I'll be using angular and Node so that I can effectively communicate with the database as well as present the infomation to the users as it needs to be. Dynamically load the blog posts from the database to display them to the user.
